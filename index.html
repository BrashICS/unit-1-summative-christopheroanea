                Dennis Ritchie is an American Computer scientist who created the C and B programming language with the help of Ken Thompson. When Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York, his dad was already working for Bell labs soon to which Ritchie would join him. Bell Labs is where Ritchie met Ken Thompson and ended up creating one of the most important programming languages. While he was working at bell labs, many knew him as a very kind and loving person as well as a "geek". Throughout Dennis' life, he has accomplished many great things and helped many of people with his astonoshing works within the computer science industry. Having passed in 2011, his siblings sent out a note of thanks to everyone sending positive words and thanking him for his works.

                    Ken Thompson is an American Computer Scientist who was born on February 4th, 1943. He was the creator of the B programming language and the predecessor to the C programming language. Later in Thompson's life, he began working with google and also helped with the creation of the "Go" language.  Eventually joining Bell Labs in 1967, Ken Thompson met Dennis Ritchie where they began to work together to develop new coding languages.
