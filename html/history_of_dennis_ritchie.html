    Life
  </h2>

    <p>
      Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York in 1941. As a kid, Dennis Ritchie was very easy going and kind and often cared for his siblings greatly. Later in Ritchie's life, he received his bachelor's degree of physics in 1963 and later received his doctor's in 1968. One year before receiving his doctors in physics , Ritchie joined a company called Bell Labs to which he would spend most of his career working there. Within Bell Labs, Ritchie was able to develop many things such as the Unix operating system, C programming and aid in the creation of B programming. In 2007, Dennis Ritchie officially retired and left his position as head of the Software Department of Lucent Technologies. In 2011, Dennis Ritchie was found dead in his apartment unfortunately passing from Cancer at age 70.

      One of Dennis Ritchie's most important creations being the C programming language was developped in 1972 at Bell Labs. C programming has helped many coders and programmers throughout the world to develop many different type of programs. To this day C programming is still used and even used in many of the programs and operating systems we use from a day to day. Some include windows, many apple programs and microsoft applications have used C programming to develop their creations. C programming has developed the computer science world as we know it today.

      Another one of Dennis Ritchie's significant creations is the Unix operating system. Unix is an operating system which many digital computers function on and it is what allows them store different data as well as process it. At first, Unix was something merely used within Bell labs and was not thought to be developped as a operating system until 1980 when more people began to use it. To this day, Unix is being used within many computers worldwide and is still being developped day by day.
