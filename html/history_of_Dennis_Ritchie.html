      One of Dennis Ritchie's most important creations being the C programming language was developped in 1972 at Bell Labs. C programming has helped many coders and programmers throughout the world to develop many different type of programs. To this day C programming is still used and even used in many of the programs and operating systems we use from a day to day. Some include windows, many apple programs and microsoft applications have used C programming to develop their creations. C programming has developed the computer science world as we know it today.
