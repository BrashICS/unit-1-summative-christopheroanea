        B programming was a progamming language developped in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. Surprisingly, B programming was a non typing programming language and merely relied on the computers memory to function and was mainly used for system programming. Unfortunately, B programming is not used much any more to this day but still played a big part in Ken Thompson's career since it was the first programming language he created. The creation of the B programming language also allowed Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thomspon to build off of it eventually creating the C programming language.
