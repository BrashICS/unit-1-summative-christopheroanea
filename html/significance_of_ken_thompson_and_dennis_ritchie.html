      What did the creation of C programming lead to and how did it change the world of Computer Science?
    </h2>

    <p>
      The creation of C programming led to many changes of the Computer Science world. Many important languages of today have been influenced by C programming such as Javascript and C++. C programming allowed the development of many computers as well since it allowed the creation of the Unix operating system which allowed systems to run better and faster. In 1972, the development of C programming mainly affected computers within the Bell labs organization but was eventually implemented within digital computers all around the world. This allowed many people to be able to afford computers working on the Unix operating system leading them to function much better. Unix allowed many computers to multitask, store more and allowed the computer to manage it's files better and be more organized. This allowed many programmers and people who worked on computers to do more work since Unix allowed everything to be easily accesible.

      How C programming affects us today
    </h1>

    <p>
      C programming still affects us greatly to this day because many different operating systems still use C programming in order to function well. Some examples are Microsoft, Windows, Mac and Linux. The reason many programs still use C programming to this day is because of how efficient it is in allowing a system to run properly. Allowing a system to operate quickly requires efficient storage and organization which C programming allows a sytem to do. C was originally created in order to store, process and organize data and it still being revised in order to be used at it's highest potential.
